RISC-V Formal Interface (RVFI)
==============================

RVFI Specification
------------------

In the following specification the term `XLEN` refers to the width of an `x` register in bits, as described in the RISC-V ISA specification. The term `NRET` refers to the maximum number of instructions that the core under test can retire in one cycle. If more than one of the retired instruction writes the same register, the channel with the highest index contains the instruction that wins the conflict. The term `ILEN` refers to the maximum instruction width for the processor under test.

The Interface consists only of output signals. Each signal is a concatenation of `NRET` values of constant width, effectively creating `NRET` channels. For simplicity, the following descriptions refer to one such channel. For example, we refer to `rvfi_valid` as a 1-bit signal, not a `NRET`-bits signal.

### Instruction Metadata

    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_valid
    output [NRET *   64 - 1 : 0] rvfi_order
    output [NRET * ILEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_insn
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_trap
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_halt
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_intr
    output [NRET * 2    - 1 : 0] rvfi_mode
    output [NRET * 2    - 1 : 0] rvfi_ixl

When the core retires an instruction, it asserts the `rvfi_valid` signal and uses the signals described below to output the details of the retired instruction. The signals below are only valid during such a cycle and can be driven to arbitrary values in a cycle in which `rvfi_valid` is not asserted.

The `rvfi_order` field must be set to the instruction index. No indices must be used twice and there must be no gaps. Instructions may be retired in a reordered fashion, as long as causality is preserved (register and memory write operations must be retired before the read operations that depend on them).

`rvfi_insn` is the instruction word for the retired instruction. In case of an instruction with fewer than `ILEN` bits, the upper bits of this output must be all zero. For compressed instructions the compressed instruction word must be output on this port. For fused instructions the complete fused instruction sequence must be output.

`rvfi_trap` must be set for an instruction that cannot be decoded as a legal instruction, such as 0x00000000.

In addition, `rvfi_trap` must be set for a misaligned memory read or write in PMAs that don't allow misaligned access, or other memory access violations. `rvfi_trap` must also be set for a jump instruction that jumps to a misaligned instruction.

The signal `rvfi_halt` must be set when the instruction is the last instruction that the core retires before halting execution. It should not be set for an instruction that triggers a trap condition if the CPU reacts to the trap by executing a trap handler. This signal enables verification of liveness properties.

`rvfi_intr` must be set for the first instruction that is part of a trap handler, i.e. an instruction that has a `rvfi_pc_rdata` that does not match the `rvfi_pc_wdata` of the previous instruction. *This signal is currently not checked.*

`rvfi_mode` must be set to the current privilege level, using the following encoding: 0=U-Mode, 1=S-Mode, 2=Reserved, 3=M-Mode

Finally `rvfi_ixl` must be set to the value of MXL/SXL/UXL in the current privilege level, using the following encoding: 1=32, 2=64

### Integer Register Read/Write

    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_rs1_addr
    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_rs2_addr
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_rs1_rdata
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_rs2_rdata

`rvfi_rs1_addr` and `rvfi_rs2_addr` are the decoded `rs1` and `rs1` register addresses for the retired instruction. For an instruction that reads no `rs1`/`rs2` register, this output can have an arbitrary value. However, if this output is nonzero then `rvfi_rs1_rdata` must carry the value stored in that register in the pre-state.

`rvfi_rs1_rdata`/`rvfi_rs2_rdata` is the value of the `x` register addressed by `rs1`/`rs2` before execution of this instruction. This output must be zero when `rs1`/`rs2` is zero.

    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_rd_addr
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_rd_wdata

`rvfi_rd_addr` is the decoded `rd` register address for the retired instruction. For an instruction that writes no `rd` register, this output must always be zero.

`rvfi_rd_wdata` is the value of the `x` register addressed by `rd` after execution of this instruction. This output must be zero when `rd` is zero.

### Program Counter

    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_rdata
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_wdata

This is the program counter (`pc`) before (`rvfi_pc_rdata`) and after (`rvfi_pc_wdata`) execution of this instruction. I.e. this is the address of the retired instruction and the address of the next instruction.

### Memory Access

    output [NRET * XLEN   - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_addr
    output [NRET * XLEN/8 - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_rmask
    output [NRET * XLEN/8 - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_wmask
    output [NRET * XLEN   - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_rdata
    output [NRET * XLEN   - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_wdata

For memory operations (`rvfi_mem_rmask` and/or `rvfi_mem_wmask` are non-zero), `rvfi_mem_addr` holds the accessed memory location.

When the define `RISCV_FORMAL_ALIGNED_MEM` is set, the address must have a 4-byte alignment for `XLEN=32` and an 8-byte alignment for `XLEN=64`. When the define is not set, then the address must point directly to the LSB or the word / half word / byte that is accessed.

`rvfi_mem_rmask` is a bitmask that specifies which bytes in `rvfi_mem_rdata` contain valid read data from `rvfi_mem_addr`.

`rvfi_mem_wmask` is a bitmask that specifies which bytes in `rvfi_mem_wdata` contain valid data that is written to `rvfi_mem_addr`.

`rvfi_mem_rdata` is the pre-state data read from `rvfi_mem_addr`. `rvfi_mem_rmask` specifies which bytes are valid.

`rvfi_mem_wdata` is the post-state data written to `rvfi_mem_addr`. `rvfi_mem_wmask` specifies which bytes are valid.

When `RISCV_FORMAL_ALIGNED_MEM` is set then `riscv-formal` assumes that unaligned memory access causes a trap.

### Alternative Arithmetic Operations

Some arithmetic operations (such as multiplication and division) are beyond to practical capabilities of even modern hardware model checkers. In order to still be able to verify things like bypassing for the arithmetic units performing those operations we define a set of alternative arithmetic operations. When the define `RISCV_FORMAL_ALTOPS` is set riscv-formal will expect the processor under test to implement those alternative operations instead.

Commutative operations (like multiplication) are replaced with addition followed by applying XOR with a bitmask that indicates the type of the operation. Noncommutative operations (like division) are replaced with subtraction followed by applying XOR with a bitmask that indicates the type of the operation.

The bitmasks are 64 bits wide. RV32 implementations only use the lower 32 bits of the bitmasks. The `*W` instructions in RV64 (suchg as `MULW`) are implemented by adding or subtracting the lower 32 bits of the operands, then XORing with the lower 32 bits of the bitmask, then sign extending the result to 64 bits.

#### Integer Multiply/Divide Instructions

<!--  for n in MUL{,H,HSU,HU} DIV{,U} REM{,U}; do echo "$( echo -n $n | md5sum ) $n"; done | cut -c1-16,36- -->

| Operation |  Add/Sub |      Bitmask       |
|:----------|:--------:|:------------------:|
| MUL       |    Add   | 0x2cdf52a55876063e |
| MULH      |    Add   | 0x15d01651f6583fb7 |
| MULHSU    |    Sub   | 0xea3969edecfbe137 |
| MULHU     |    Add   | 0xd13db50d949ce5e8 |
| DIV       |    Sub   | 0x29bbf66f7f8529ec |
| DIVU      |    Sub   | 0x8c629acb10e8fd70 |
| REM       |    Sub   | 0xf5b7d8538da68fa5 |
| REMU      |    Sub   | 0xbc4402413138d0e1 |

### Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

For each supported CSR there are four additional output ports:

    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_<csrname>_rmask
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_<csrname>_wmask
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_<csrname>_rdata
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_<csrname>_wdata

The `rmask` and `wmask` ports specify which bits of `rdata` and `wdata` are valid.

It is always valid for an instruction to activate more `rmask`/`rdata` bits
than required by the instruction, as long as the reported bits correctly reflect
the machine state.

If reading a CSR has side effects, those side effects are not triggered by raised
`rmask` bits but by the type of the instruction.

The Verilog define `RISCV_FORMAL_CSR_<CSRNAME>` must be set for each CSR traced
via RVFI by the core under test.

See [RISC-V Formal CSR Sematics](csrs.md) for the exact semantics of CSR values
output via RVFI.

### Handling of Speculative Execution

Out-of-order cores that execute speculatively can commit speculative instructions on RVFI.

Rollbacks must be output via the rollback interface, that is enabled when `RISCV_FORMAL_ROLLBACK` is defined:

    output [ 0 : 0] rvfi_rollback_valid
    output [63 : 0] rvfi_rollback_order

All RVFI packets output _prior_ to the cycle with asserted `rvfi_rollback_valid` with a `rvfi_order` field of _greater or equal_ to `rvfi_rollback_order` are invalidated by a rollback event.

RVFI packets output in the same cycle as `rvfi_rollback_valid` are already part of the new instruction stream re-starting at the instruction number indicated in `rvfi_rollback_order`.


RVFI TODOs and Requests for Comments
------------------------------------

The following section contains notes on future extensions to RVFI. They will come part of the spec as soon as there is at least one core that implements the feature, and a matching formal check that utilises the feature. In many cases the additional ports will only be used (and expected from the core) when additional to-be-defined `RISCV_FORMAL_*` Verilog defines are set.

### Support for fused instructions

Fused instructions are simply handled as larger instructions in RVFI. Additional `rvfi_rs*` ports (or even `rvfi_rd*` ports) may be added to accommodate the fused instructions.

No instruction models for fused instructions have been created yet.

Alternatively fused instructions may be output as individual instructions in separate RVFI channels.

### Modelling of Floating-Point State

The following is the proposed RVFI extension for floating point ISAs:

    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs1_addr
    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs2_addr
    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs3_addr
    output [NRET *    5 - 1 : 0] rvfi_frd_addr
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs1_rvalid
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs2_rvalid
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs3_rvalid
    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_frd_wvalid
    output [NRET * FLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs1_rdata
    output [NRET * FLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs2_rdata
    output [NRET * FLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_frs3_rdata
    output [NRET * FLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_frd_wdata
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_fcsr_rmask
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_fcsr_wmask
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_fcsr_rdata
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_fcsr_wdata

Since `f0` is not a zero register, additional `*_[rw]valid` signals are required to indicate if `frs1`, `frs2`, `frs3`, and `frd` and their corresponding pre- or post-values are valid.

Alternative arithmetic operations (`RISCV_FORMAL_ALTOPS`) will be defined for all non-trivial floating point operations.

### Modelling of Virtual Memory

For processors with support for S-mode and virtual memory we define the following additional RVFI signals for data load/stores:

    output [NRET *   64 - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_paddr
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_pte0
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_pte1
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_pte2
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_pte3

And the following additional RVFI signals for instruction fetches:

    output [NRET *   64 - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_paddr
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_pte0
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_pte1
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_pte2
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_pc_pte3

And we require that the `satp` CSR is observable through RVFI:

    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_satp_rmask
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_satp_wmask
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_satp_rdata
    output [NRET * XLEN - 1 : 0] rvfi_csr_satp_wdata

The `rvfi_mem_paddr` field carries the physical address of the memory access. The `rvfi_mem_pte[0123]` fields carry the values of the page table entries used to convert `rvfi_mem_addr` to `rvfi_mem_paddr`. Unused `rvfi_mem_pte[0123]` fields must always be set to zero.

For memory accesses in M-mode, or with `satp.MODE=0`, `rvfi_mem_paddr` must have the same value as `rvfi_mem_addr` and all four `rvfi_mem_pte[0123]` fields must be set to zero.

For example in Sv32 mode, modulo missing fences, `rvfi_mem_pte1` must carry the value of the 32-bit word at the following memory location:

```
pt1 = rvfi_csr_satp_rdata & 0x003fffff
vpn1 = (rvfi_mem_addr >> 22) & 0x3ff
pte1_addr = (pt1 << 12) | (vpn1 << 2)
```

And `rvfi_mem_pte0` must carry the value of the 32-bit word at the following memory location (or zero if `pte1.X` or `pte1.R` or `!pte1.V`):

```
pt0 = rvfi_mem_pte1 >> 10
vpn0 = (rvfi_mem_addr >> 12) & 0x3ff
pte0_addr = (pt0 << 12) | (vpn0 << 2)
```

Finally, `rvfi_mem_paddr` must be set to the following address:

```
ppn = rvfi_mem_pte0 >> 10
offset = rvfi_mem_addr & 0xfff
rvfi_mem_paddr = (ppn << 12) | offset
```

### Modelling of Atomic Memory Operations

AMO instructions (`AMOSWAP.W`, etc.) can be modelled using the existing `rvfi_mem_*` interface by asserting bits in both `rvfi_mem_rmask` and `rvfi_mem_wmask`.

There is also no extension to the RVFI port necessary to accommodate the `LR`, `SC`, `FENCE` and `FENCE.I` instructions.

Verification of this instructions for a single-core systems can be done using the RVFI port only. A strategy must be defined to verify their correct behavior in multicore systems.

For atomic instructions with `rd = x0` a core might have no way of knowing the old or new value of the memory location. For those situations we add an additional RVFI output port:

    output [NRET          - 1 : 0] rvfi_mem_extamo

When `rvfi_mem_extamo` is set, `rvfi_mem_wdata` carries the `rs2` value used with the atomic instruction instead of the new value in the memory location. `rvfi_mem_rmask` is all-zeros in this case.

### Skipping instructions

Consider the following sequence of instructions:

        ....
        add t0,t1,t2
        beqz t3,label
        sub t0,t1,t3
    label:
        ....

When t3 has a non-zero value the processor could decide not to schedule the add instruction because its value is never going to be used. In this case the processor would be unable to produce a valid RVFI trace for the instruction sequence.

An additional signal can be added to RVFI that can be used to mark such instructions:

    output [NRET        - 1 : 0] rvfi_skip

When `rvfi_skip` is high the core may output arbitrary data on the `*_rdata` and `*_wdata` ports (excluding `rvfi_pc_rdata` and `rvfi_pc_wdata`). The register values written by such intrustions may only be observed by other skipped instructions. An additional formal proof must be added to check this property.

Memory operations (`rvfi_mem_rmask` and/or `rvfi_mem_wmask` are non-zero) can not be skipped.
